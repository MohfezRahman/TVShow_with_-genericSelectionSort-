Step 2:  in your main method, write code to read in shows.txt into a generic list of TVShow classes

Step 3:  Modify TVShow.java so that it extends Comparable can be sorted by streamingService.  If two objects have identical streamingService, then sort by showName.

Step 4:  Make sure the list containing the TVShows is a LinkedList

Step 5:  Sort the LinkedList of TVShows using the generic sort method included in step 1

Step 6:  After sorting, print the LinkedList of TVShows using a ListIterator
